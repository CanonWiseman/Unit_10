let PI = 3.14159;
PI = 42;

//or if you didnt want to change PI you could just use a const variable on it.

// 1. with var you can both redeclare and reassign a value but with let you can only reassign a value. Also Let is in a block scope

// 2. Const won't let you reassign or redeclare a value. Const also creates a block scope.

//3. Let will let you reassign values but const will not.

//4. Variable hoisting is the way the compiler takes the undefined value to the top of the page before it is assigned to a value but only works with VAR and not let or const.
